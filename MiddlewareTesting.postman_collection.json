Most human coronaviruses (HCoVs) fall into one of two serotypes, OC43-like and 229E-like; however, the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was quickly linked to infection with a novel CoV, SARS-CoV Peiris et al., 2003) , and HCoV-NL63, has been recognized recently as a human pathogen (van der Hoek et al., 2004) .

SARS-CoV has four structural proteins, the S, N, M, and E proteins that have various functions. The S protein forms spikes on the virion surface and is crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. It also induces protective immunity, and is associated with host range, tissue tropism and virulence (Sanchez et al., 1999) . The N protein forms the nucleocapsid; the M protein interacts with the nucleocapsid and forms the internal viral core; and the E protein is associated with the viral envelope. SARS-CoV is genetically distinct from previously described coronaviruses, which have been placed into three antigenic groups: I, II, and III. Human coronaviruses, i.e., 229E-like and OC43-like, belong to groups I and II, respectively, and are recognized as the second most common cause of upper respiratory disease, but are associated infrequently with serious lower respiratory tract disease (El-Sahly et al., 2000; Hendley et al., 1972 , Makela et al., 1998 Falsey et al., 2002) . However, SARS-CoV is usually associated with serious lower respiratory tract disease, having a fatality rate as ranging between 10% and 15% that may be as high as 50% in patients >60 years of age Enserink, 2003; Holmes, 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . Although the global spread of SARS-CoV was stopped in June 2003, six instances of laboratory-acquired infections have been confirmed and a cluster of sporadic cases have been detected in Guangdong Province, China, between December 2003 and April 2004 (Liang et al., 2004 , demonstrating the potential for SARS to re-emerge and possibly become pandemic.\",\n    \"id\":\"dc8a528cb67237951c77fc23838ac724\",\n    \"article_id_s\":\"39f84a0a09b6eabcc5426a452c3b7bafddc69f2a\",\n    \"size_i\":2525,\n    \"_version_\":1664508650629103620\n  },\n  \"5\":{\n    \"section_s\":\"regulation of ifn signaling pathway\",\n    \"text_t\":\"Production of type I IFNs is an important component of the host innate immunity against viral infection, and activation of IFN cascade starts from recognition of viral components by two distinct pattern recognition receptors (PRRs); TLRs and retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) including melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I. TLR3, TLR7\\/8, and TLR9 function at either cell surface or endosomal membranes and are involved in antiviral response (Baccala et al., 2007) . When pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are sensed by PRRs, signal transduction is turned on to activate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and activating protein (AP)-1, and release of NF-B from its inhibitor IB (Baccala et al., 2007) . Activated AP-1, IRF3 and NF-B are translocated to the nucleus and bind their positive regulatory domains (PRDs) within the IFN promoter region and instigate the production of IFNs by recruiting CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding)-binding protein (CBP) to form an enhanceosome complex for IFN transcription (Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) .

These include binary bioweapons, which are two-component systems that are relatively safe to handle but become deadly when the two components come together on deployment. The same technology has been used with chemical weapon systems. The Jason Group also postulated the existence of designer genes, in which specific unnatural gene sequences are built into viruses or other life forms to incorporate into the genome of the unsuspecting host, which later becomes the victim. On a similar note, they suggested that, once gene therapy becomes a medical reality, the technology that should one day allow medicine to repair or replace defective genes in a diseased individual might be subverted to introduce pathogenic sequences into healthy individuals. In addition, stealth viruses could be fashioned by a researcher to infect the host but remain silent until activated by some physiological or environmental trigger. New zoonotic agents, referred to by the Jason Group as host-swapping diseases, might be developed specifically for bioweapon purposes by modifying existing pathogens to seek human hosts.

Several clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of mipomersen to reduce Apo B-100, LDL-C, total cholesterol levels, as well as Lp(a) levels. In healthy volunteers, Apo B-100 and LDL-C levels were reduced by 21% and 34% (Akdim et al. 2010) .
